What is a pixel? Explain briefly the role of pixels in creating an image on a CRT screen. \n2. Discuss some of the main differences between a CRT monitor and an LCD monitor. \n3. What is meant by the “color depth” of a monitor? Does it have any relationships with the  \n     amount of display memory in the adapter card? \n4  How is the movement of the electron gun inside a CRT controlled?  \n5. Explain why an image on a CRT screen needs to be refreshed at least 60 times per second. \n6. Describe the technique of “interlacing” mentioning its merits and demerits  \n7. What is the utility of a video adapter card in a personal computer?  \n8. A 15-inch monitor having an aspect ratio 4:3 has 1080 pixels along a single horizontal line and a \nscreen refresh rate of 60 Hz. Calculate its horizontal scan rate in kHz, resolution in dpi and dot \npitch in mm (1 inch =2.54 cm) \n9. Explain the following terms with reference to a cathode ray tube :  \n          (a) vertical scan rate            (b) resolution (c) dot-pitch \n11. Write short notes on : (a) VGA (b) AGP (c) LCD (d) LED (e) Plasma Panel Display \n12. Compare a LED  monitor with an LCD monitor \n13 Explain the meaning of the following terms relating to the sampling of an analog signal: \n(i) Nyquist sampling theorem, (ii) Nyquist rate. \n14 Show  by  means  of  a  diagram  how  sampling  of  an  analog  signal  at  a  rate  lower  than  the  Nyquist \nrate  can  generate  additional  lower- frequency  alias  signals  to  those  present  in  the  original \nwaveform. How can this be avoided? \n15 Define the meaning of the term “quantization interval” and how this influences the accuracy of \nthe  sampling  process  of  an  analog  signal.  Hence  with  the  aid  of  a  diagram,  explain  the  meaning  of \nthe terms “quantization error” and “quantization noise”. \n---------------------------------------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx--------------------------------------- ",

    "Here's an analysis of the provided text from a social media expert's perspective, with 5 suggestions for improvement:",
    "**Analysis of Original Text:**",
    "The text is a formal academic assignment brief. While perfectly functional for a printed handout or an email attachment, it lacks the characteristics that drive engagement and readability on social media platforms. It's purely instructional, has no visual cues, no interactive elements, and no social media specific formatting. The sentiment is neutral and professional, but not motivating for a social media context.",
    "---",
    "**5 Suggestions for Improvement:**",
    "1.  **Improve Engagement:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Transform the announcement into an interactive post by starting with a direct address and an open-ended question that encourages students to think about the content.",
    "*   **Example Implementation:** \"Hello MCA V Semester students! 👋 Ready to dive deep into Multimedia Systems? Your new assignment is out! Which topic are you most looking forward to exploring, or which question seems the most challenging? Share your thoughts below!\" This encourages interaction and gets students thinking about the assignment before they even read all the questions.",
    "2.  **Enhance Readability:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Utilize social media-friendly formatting to break down the information into easily digestible chunks, making it quick to scan and understand key details.",
    "*   **Example Implementation:**",
    "*   **Start with a concise summary:** \"Your Multimedia Systems Assignment for MCA V Semester 2025 is here!\"",
    "*   **Bold key information:** **Submission Date: Friday 15 September (2-3 PM)**, **Register (Classmate 100 Pages & Above)**.",
    "*   **Use bullet points or numbered lists:** Clearly separate instructions and each assignment question.",
    "*   **Incorporate relevant emojis:** 📅 for submission date, 📝 for instructions, 💡 for questions, to add visual interest and guide the eye.",
    "*   **Add line breaks:** Create ample white space between sections to prevent overwhelming the reader.",
    "3.  **Optimize Hashtags:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Implement a strategic mix of broad, specific, and potentially trending hashtags to improve discoverability, categorize the content, and reach the intended audience.",
    "*   **Example Implementation:** #MCASemesterV #MultimediaSystems #AssignmentAlert #TechEducation #CRTvsLCD #Pixels #SamplingTheory #ComputerGraphics #StudentLife #Deadlines (If the institution is known, add a specific hashtag like #[UniversityName]MCA)",
    "4.  **Strengthen CTA (Call to Action):**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Provide a clear, actionable, and supportive call to action that reinforces the deadline and encourages proactive engagement, while also offering a channel for support.",
    "*   **Example Implementation:** \"Don't wait until the last minute – start planning your research and answers today! 💡 Remember the submission is **Friday, September 15th (2-3 PM)**. Good luck, and feel free to reach out to your instructor with any questions!\" This directly tells students what to do, reiterates the urgency, and provides a safety net.",
    "5.  **Improve Sentiment:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Infuse the post with a more encouraging, supportive, and slightly less formal tone to motivate students and create a more positive learning environment, while still maintaining academic professionalism.",
    "*   **Example Implementation:** Begin with a friendly greeting (as in engagement), use phrases like \"We're excited to see your in-depth understanding of these fundamental multimedia concepts. You've got this! ✨\" and end with a positive closing. This makes the assignment feel less like a bureaucratic task and more like a valuable learning opportunity."
