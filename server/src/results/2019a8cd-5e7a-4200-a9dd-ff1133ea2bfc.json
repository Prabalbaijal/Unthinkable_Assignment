    "This text is a detailed academic assignment, highly technical and structured for a student to complete, not for social media consumption. To transform it for a social media audience, we need to extract the core educational concepts and present them in an engaging, accessible way.",
    "Here are 5 suggestions to improve engagement, readability, hashtags, CTA, and sentiment for a social media context:",
    "---",
    "### Social Media Expert Analysis & Suggestions:",
    "**Overall Assessment:** The original text is a dense, academic assignment with a formal, instructional tone. It is not designed for social media and lacks all elements crucial for online engagement. To adapt it, we need to focus on distilling complex information into digestible, interesting, and interactive content.",
    "---",
    "**1. Improve Engagement:**",
    "*   **Analysis:** The current text presents a series of problems to be solved, which is an engagement strategy for a student in a course, but not for a general social media audience. There's no hook, real-world connection, or interactive element.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Start with a relatable hook or a compelling question that connects data compression to everyday experiences. Frame the topic as a fascinating challenge or a crucial technology rather than a dry academic task. Encourage curiosity and interaction by posing questions related to the core concepts.",
    "*   **Example Application:** Instead of \"Construct The Huffman Tree and Generate Huffman Codes,\" try: \"🤯 Ever wondered how your photos and videos shrink without losing quality? That's the magic of #DataCompression!\" or \"Can you crack the code of efficiency? Dive into Huffman and Shannon-Fano!\"",
    "**2. Improve Readability:**",
    "*   **Analysis:** The text is packed with technical jargon, long sentences, and detailed instructions, making it very dense and visually unappealing for social media.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Break down complex ideas into shorter, simpler sentences and very short paragraphs. Use bullet points judiciously for key takeaways rather than detailed instructions. Employ emojis to break up text and add visual cues, and utilize line breaks to create more whitespace. Focus on the *why* and *what* briefly before hinting at the *how*.",
    "*   **Example Application:** Instead of listing all calculation steps, focus on the comparison: \"We're comparing #HuffmanCoding and #ShannonFano to see which algorithm compresses data more efficiently! Think about bits saved vs. redundancy.\" Use emojis like 🚀, 🤔, 👇 to guide the eye and convey tone.",
    "**3. Improve Hashtags:**",
    "*   **Analysis:** The original text has no hashtags, which means it's undiscoverable and doesn't leverage social media's indexing system.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Incorporate a strategic mix of broad, niche, and trending hashtags to increase visibility and reach relevant audiences. Include keywords directly from the content and broader industry terms.",
    "*   **Example Application:**",
    "*   **Niche/Specific:** #HuffmanCoding #ShannonFano #DataCompression #InformationTheory #Algorithms",
    "*   **Broad/Community:** #ComputerScience #TechExplained #CodingChallenge #STEMeducation #Programming",
    "*   **Trending/Engagement:** #LearnToCode #TechTips #ProblemSolving",
    "**4. Improve CTA (Call to Action):**",
    "*   **Analysis:** The current text's \"CTA\" is implicitly \"solve these problems,\" which is only relevant to a student audience. There is no explicit call for social media interaction.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Add a clear, concise, and engaging call to action that prompts social media users to comment, share, or further explore the topic. Encourage discussion or ask for opinions.",
    "*   **Example Application:**",
    "*   \"Which compression method do you find more intuitive or efficient? Share your thoughts below! 👇\"",
    "*   \"Drop a 'YES' if you'd like a simplified explanation of Huffman codes!\"",
    "*   \"Tag a friend who loves solving complex algorithms!\"",
    "*   \"Want to learn more? Check out our link in bio!\" (if applicable)",
    "**5. Improve Sentiment:**",
    "*   **Analysis:** The sentiment is purely neutral, formal, and instructional, suitable for an academic assignment but not for captivating a social media audience.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Transform the tone from dry and academic to enthusiastic, curious, and educational. Make the topic feel exciting and approachable, emphasizing the wonder and utility of data compression. Use engaging language and emotional appeal where appropriate.",
    "*   **Example Application:** Use phrases like \"fascinating world,\" \"incredible algorithms,\" \"magic of data compression.\" Employ exclamation marks and emojis to convey enthusiasm. Frame it as an exploration (\"Dive deep...\") or a challenge (\"Can you crack...\"), rather than just a set of instructions."
