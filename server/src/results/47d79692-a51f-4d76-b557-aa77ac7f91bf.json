    "This text is a technical academic assignment, not at all optimized for social media. To transform it for a social media audience, the goal is to make it engaging, digestible, and interactive, while still conveying its educational value.",
    "Here are 5 suggestions to improve engagement, readability, hashtags, CTA, and sentiment:",
    "1.  **Improve Engagement: Turn it into a Challenge/Quiz with a Real-World Hook**",
    "*   **Current State:** A dry list of instructions.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Instead of presenting it as an assignment, frame it as a \"Tech Challenge\" or \"Coding Brain Teaser.\" Start with a relatable real-world problem that data compression solves (e.g., \"Ever wondered how your videos stream so smoothly or why files download so fast? It's all thanks to data compression!\"). Then, present *one simplified part* of the problem as an interactive question.",
    "*   **Example Opening:** \"💡 **Tech Challenge!** Decode this: How much info is *really* in the word 'DATA'? We see symbols every day, but how do computers make them super efficient? Let's explore Huffman Coding! Can you figure out the Huffman code for 'AEMPAALEQ' given these frequencies? (See image/details below 👇)\"",
    "*   **Why it helps:** Piques curiosity, makes a complex topic approachable, encourages active participation rather than passive reading, and uses a narrative to draw users in.",
    "2.  **Improve Readability: Break Down Complexity with Visuals, Emojis, and Clear Structure**",
    "*   **Current State:** Dense paragraphs, technical jargon, no visual breaks.",
    "*   **Suggestion:**",
    "*   **Use an Image/Infographic:** Represent the Huffman tree construction visually. This is far more effective than just describing it.",
    "*   **Bullet Points & Bolding:** Break down the calculations into clear, concise bullet points with bolded key terms.",
    "*   **Simplify Language:** Where possible, translate academic terms into slightly more accessible language (e.g., \"Information content of each symbol\" could be \"How much 'surprise' or 'newness' does each symbol carry?\").",
    "*   **Emojis:** Use relevant emojis (like 📊, 💻, 🧠, 👇) to break up text and guide the eye.",
    "*   **Example:**",
    "\"**Problem 1: Huffman's Magic!**",
    "String to compress: \"AEMPAALEQ\"",
    "Frequencies: A:35, M:25, E:15, P:10, D:5, L:5, Q:5",
    "👉 **Your Task (Simplified!):**",
    "*   **Build the Huffman Tree:** Visualize how symbols merge based on frequency. (See image!)",
    "*   **Generate Codes:** What are the binary codes for A, M, E...?",
    "*   **Decode!** If you got the code '1011001...', what's the original string?",
    "📊 We'll also dive into:",
    "*   **Information Content:** The 'value' of each letter.",
    "*   **Shannon-Fano vs. Huffman:** Which algorithm is more efficient?",
    "*   **Total Bits:** How many bits do we *save*? 💾\"",
    "*   **Why it helps:** Makes the information less intimidating, easier to scan, and more visually appealing for a fast-scrolling social media feed.",
    "3.  **Optimize Hashtags: Mix Broad, Niche, and Engagement-Focused Tags**",
    "*   **Current State:** No hashtags.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Use a blend of popular, educational, and specific technical hashtags.",
    "*   **Example:**",
    "#DataCompression #HuffmanCoding #ShannonFano #ComputerScience #TechExplained #Algorithm #CodingChallenge #LearnToCode #InformationTheory #TechTips #ProblemSolving #DigitalLiteracy #CSMajor #Engineering",
    "*   **Why it helps:** Increases discoverability for different audiences – from those generally interested in tech to specific computer science students looking for resources or challenges.",
    "4.  **Strengthen Call to Action (CTA): Clear, Direct, and Interactive**",
    "*   **Current State:** Implicit \"do the assignment.\"",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Create explicit CTAs that encourage interaction, learning, or sharing.",
    "*   **Example CTAs:**",
    "*   \"👇 **Comment below** with your Huffman code for 'A'!\"",
    "*   \"🧠 Can you guess which algorithm is usually better? **Vote in our poll!**\" (if platform allows)",
    "*   \"Want the full solution or a deeper dive? **Link in bio!**\" (pointing to a blog post, video, or a more detailed solution)",
    "*   \"**Hit 'Like'** if you think data compression is fascinating!\"",
    "*   \"**Tag a friend** who loves coding challenges!\"",
    "*   **Why it helps:** Guides the user on what to do next, converts passive viewers into active participants, and drives traffic or interaction metrics.",
    "5.  **Enhance Sentiment: Inject Enthusiasm, Curiosity, and a Sense of Accomplishment**",
    "*   **Current State:** Neutral, purely factual, academic tone.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Use enthusiastic language, emojis, and frame the learning process as exciting and rewarding. Emphasize the *why* behind the concepts (e.g., faster internet, smaller files).",
    "*   **Example Phrases/Tone:**",
    "*   \"Unlocking the secrets of efficient data storage! 🔑\"",
    "*   \"Dive into the fascinating world of algorithms!\"",
    "*   \"Mastering these concepts is key to understanding modern tech. 🚀\"",
    "*   \"Feel the satisfaction of cracking these codes!\"",
    "*   \"Ever wondered how we shrink massive files? This is how!\"",
    "*   **Why it helps:** Makes the content more appealing and less daunting. It creates a positive association with learning the topic, encouraging users to engage with complex material rather than scroll past it."
