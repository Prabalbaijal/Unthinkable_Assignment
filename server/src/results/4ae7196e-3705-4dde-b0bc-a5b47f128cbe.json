    "This is an excellent opportunity to transform a formal communication into an engaging social media post! Here are 5 suggestions to improve engagement, readability, hashtags, CTA, and sentiment for a social media version of this text:",
    "---",
    "### Suggestions:",
    "1.  **Improve Engagement:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Start with an exciting hook or a direct question to the target audience (software engineers/developers). Frame the assessment not just as a hurdle, but as a compelling challenge and a chance to shine.",
    "*   **Example Application:** Instead of \"Dear Candidate,\" kick off with something like: \"Calling all brilliant Software Engineers! 🚀 Ready to build something impactful and showcase your skills?\" or \"Got what it takes to revolutionize social media analysis? Our latest project challenge awaits!\" This immediately grabs attention and invites interaction.",
    "2.  **Enhance Readability:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Break down dense paragraphs and bullet points into short, punchy sentences and visually appealing micro-segments. Utilize emojis, line breaks, and possibly bold text (if the platform allows) to highlight key information without overwhelming the reader.",
    "*   **Example Application:**",
    "*   Condense \"We believe in evaluating candidates through practical, real-world scenarios. Here's your project challenge:\" to \"We believe in *real-world* challenges. Here's yours! 👇\"",
    "*   Use emojis for requirements: \"Upload PDFs & Images 📁 | Extract text w/ OCR 🤖 | Clean, production-ready code ✨\"",
    "*   Visually separate key sections like \"Timeline\" and \"Deliverables\" with emojis or short headings.",
    "3.  **Optimize Hashtags:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Implement a strategic mix of broad, niche, and company-specific hashtags to maximize visibility and target the right audience.",
    "*   **Example Application:**",
    "*   **Broad:** `#SoftwareEngineer #TechJobs #Hiring #CareerOpportunity`",
    "*   **Niche/Relevant Skills:** `#CodingChallenge #AI #ML #OCR #Python #JavaScript` (or specific tech encouraged) `#DocumentProcessing #UX`",
    "*   **Company/Location:** `#[CompanyName]Careers #[CompanyName]Tech #[City]Jobs`",
    "*   **Project Specific:** `#SocialMediaAnalyzer`",
    "*   **Placement:** Place 2-3 key hashtags within the main body for context and add 5-7 more at the end.",
    "4.  **Strengthen Call to Action (CTA):**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Make the CTA crystal clear, concise, and compelling. Guide the user directly on the next step they should take to engage with the opportunity. Provide a direct link or clear instruction.",
    "*   **Example Application:** Instead of \"Confirm receipt of this email,\" which isn't applicable to social media, direct them to where they can find the full brief or submit their interest.",
    "*   \"Intrigued? Get the full project brief & submission details here: [Link to career page/landing page]\"",
    "*   \"Ready to dive in? DM us for the complete challenge details! ✉️\"",
    "*   \"Deadline Sep 1, 2025! Don't miss out – Apply/Learn more: [Link]\"",
    "5.  **Inject Positive Sentiment:**",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Shift from the formal, neutral tone of an email to an enthusiastic, encouraging, and empowering voice. Emphasize the positive aspects of the challenge and the potential for candidates to showcase their best work.",
    "*   **Example Application:**",
    "*   Use words like \"exciting,\" \"opportunity,\" \"showcase,\" \"innovate,\" \"challenge yourself.\"",
    "*   Instead of \"We'll evaluate based on...\", try \"We're looking forward to seeing your innovative solutions, excellent code quality, and impressive problem-solving skills!\"",
    "*   Conclude with a high-energy sign-off: \"Good luck, future innovators!\" or \"We can't wait to see what you build! Let's connect! #GoodLuck\""
