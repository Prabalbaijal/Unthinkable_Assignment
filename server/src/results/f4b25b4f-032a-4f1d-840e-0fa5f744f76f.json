    "This text is a highly effective resume/CV, but when translated directly to social media, it loses the interactive and engaging qualities essential for platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or even a personal blog post. As a social media expert, here are 5 suggestions to transform this professional content into engaging social media material:",
    "---",
    "### Social Media Analysis & Suggestions for Prabal Baijal's Content",
    "**Overall Assessment:** The text is packed with impressive technical achievements and educational milestones. However, it's presented in a very formal, document-centric style. For social media, we need to inject personality, make it easily digestible, and provoke interaction.",
    "Here are 5 suggestions:",
    "1.  **Improve Engagement by Storytelling and Impact-Focused Narratives:**",
    "*   **Problem:** The project descriptions, while detailed and technically sound, read like academic reports. They lack a \"hook\" or a clear articulation of the *problem* solved and the *real-world impact*. Social media users scroll quickly and are drawn to narratives and relatable problems.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** For each major project or achievement, create a mini-story. Start with a captivating question or a relatable problem, then introduce your solution, its key tech, and most importantly, the *impact* or *outcome*.",
    "*   **Example (for Breast Cancer Classification):** Instead of starting with \"Developed a machine learning pipeline...\", try: \"Imagine empowering doctors with AI for early cancer detection. 🔬 My latest project involved building a robust ML pipeline to classify malignant vs. benign tumors with 96.49% accuracy! #AIforGood #MachineLearning\"",
    "*   **Example (for Credit Card Fraud):** \"Ever worried about online security? 💳 I tackled the challenge of real-world credit card fraud by building an end-to-end detection system. Using techniques like SMOTE for imbalanced data, I achieved a stunning 0.98 ROC-AUC with XGBoost. The fight against fraud just got smarter! #CyberSecurity #DataScience\"",
    "*   **Example (for Coding Battle):** \"Love competitive coding? 💻 Thrilled to share 'Coding Battle' – my real-time web app for 1v1 DSA showdowns! We've got live code evaluation, multiple languages, and social features to challenge your friends. Check it out! [Link to Project Demo/GitHub] #WebDevelopment #DSA #ReactJS\"",
    "2.  **Enhance Readability with Visual Breaks, Emojis, and Prioritized Information:**",
    "*   **Problem:** The text is dense, with long bullet points and a lack of visual cues to guide the eye. The initial contact line is particularly hard to parse (`§ Prabalbaijal|ï prabal-baijal| € LeetCode| # prabalbaijal10@gmail.com|H +91-9870966261`).",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Break down information into shorter, digestible chunks. Use emojis strategically to add visual interest and emphasize points. Clearly separate contact information and professional links.",
    "*   **Restructure Contact Info:** Instead of the messy initial line, list these clearly:",
    "*   🔗 Connect with me: [LinkedIn Profile URL]",
    "*   💻 See my code: [GitHub Profile URL]",
    "*   🏆 LeetCode Progress: [LeetCode Profile URL]",
    "*   📧 Email: prabalbaijal10@gmail.com",
    "*   📞 Phone: +91-9870966261 (Consider if this is appropriate for public social media or better shared privately)",
    "*   **Use bullet points for *key takeaways* rather than full descriptions.** Bold important keywords (e.g., **96.49% test accuracy**, **XGBoost**, **real-time web app**). Use line breaks to create \"white space\" between paragraphs or ideas.",
    "*   **Example of improved project readability:**",
    "> **Coding Battle: Real-time DSA Challenges! ⚔️**",
    "> A web app for 1v1 coding battles with live evaluation.",
    ">",
    "> **Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Socket.IO, Redis, JWT, Judge0 API.",
    ">",
    "> *   **Seamless IDE experience:** Integrated in-browser editor with syntax highlighting and 4+ language support.",
    "> *   **Real-time sync:** Socket.io for problem delivery, code submission, and scoring.",
    "> *   **Smart execution:** Judge0 API integration for secure, sandboxed code execution + custom TLE/runtime error handling.",
    "> *   **Social Features:** Friend requests, friends list, and competitive play.",
    ">",
    "> Check out the demo! [Link]",
    "3.  **Implement Strategic and Diverse Hashtagging:**",
    "*   **Problem:** There are currently no hashtags, which significantly limits discoverability and reach on social media.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Use a mix of broad, niche, and trending hashtags relevant to your skills, projects, and career goals. Aim for 5-10 relevant hashtags per post.",
    "*   **Skill-specific:** #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #DataScience #WebDevelopment #ReactJS #NodeJS #Python #Java #DSA #SQL #TensorFlow #Keras #XGBoost",
    "*   **Project-specific:** #BreastCancerAwareness #FraudDetection #CompetitiveProgramming #RealTimeApp #FullStack",
    "*   **Career/Industry:** #SoftwareEngineer #DeveloperLife #TechJobs #AI #TechInnovation #CodingCommunity #MNNIT #NIMCET",
    "*   **Personal Branding:** #PrabalBaijal (If you want to create a personal brand hashtag)",
    "*   **Example (for achievements):** \"Proud to share my journey! Achieved Knight Badge on LeetCode (Top 5.64%) and solved 1000+ DSA problems. Also secured AIR 113 in NIMCET 2023 for my MCA at MNNIT Allahabad! #CodeLife #DSAChampion #LeetCode #NIMCET #MNNIT #TechAchievements\"",
    "4.  **Incorporate Clear and Actionable Calls to Action (CTAs):**",
    "*   **Problem:** The text is purely informational; it doesn't prompt the reader to do anything. Social media posts should guide users on the next step.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** End every post with a clear, concise CTA. This could be to connect, comment, visit a portfolio, or ask a question.",
    "*   **Examples:**",
    "*   \"What are your thoughts on [topic related to project]? Let me know in the comments! 👇\"",
    "*   \"Interested in collaborating on a similar project? DM me!\"",
    "*   \"Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey! [LinkedIn URL]\"",
    "*   \"Explore the full project details and code on my GitHub: [GitHub Repo URL]\"",
    "*   \"Hit 'Like' if you're passionate about [topic] too!\"",
    "*   \"Looking for internship opportunities in [specific area]. Reach out if you have leads!\"",
    "5.  **Inject Personality and Positive Sentiment for Relatability:**",
    "*   **Problem:** The current language is objective and formal, lacking the enthusiasm and personal touch that resonates on social media. It doesn't convey Prabal's passion or confidence beyond factual achievements.",
    "*   **Suggestion:** Use more active voice, expressive language, and a confident, enthusiastic tone. Share your excitement about learning, building, and solving problems. Emojis can also subtly enhance sentiment.",
    "*   **Example:** Instead of \"MCA - Master of Computer Applications,\" use: \"Thrilled to be pursuing my MCA at MNNIT Allahabad, diving deeper into the world of tech! 🚀 CPI: 8.92 - focused on pushing boundaries!\"",
    "*   **Example:** \"My journey in tech began with a strong foundation in Physics, Math, and Computer Science. It fueled my passion for problem-solving! 💡\"",
    "*   **Example (for achievements):** \"Absolutely ecstatic to have achieved Knight Badge on LeetCode – a testament to countless hours and unwavering dedication! Always pushing for the next challenge. 💪\"",
    "*   **Use words like:** \"proud,\" \"excited,\" \"thrilled,\" \"passionate,\" \"innovative,\" \"challenging,\" \"empowering,\" \"driven.\" This creates a more approachable and relatable persona."
